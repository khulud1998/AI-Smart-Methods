### In this task, we were asked to develop a program that can detect faces using OpenCV and Python 

- First, we need to install OpenCV
    1.  in the Terminal, I wrote the code below in order to install OpenCV For MacBook air and Python 3.9 version 
   `pip install opencv-python`

- Second, using Haar cascades as a method for face detection because it contains a set of input data. OpenCV contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. we will be using the face classifier.
    1.  Open haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml in the file section
    2. Click on the Raw
    3. Save this file in your working area
- Third write the code in the file section and make close attention to the note beside it [Here ](https://github.com/khulud1998/AI-Smart-Methods/blob/main/3.1%20Detect%20Faces%20in%20jpg%20version.py)
